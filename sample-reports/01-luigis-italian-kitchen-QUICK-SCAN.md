## Red Flags to Investigate

⚠️ **Unverified financials** - Seller claims $850K revenue (verify via 3 years tax returns)  
⚠️ **Service complaints** - Peak-hour issues suggest staffing problems  
⚠️ **Menu fatigue** - Customers note lack of innovation (opportunity or warning sign?)  
⚠️ **Owner involvement** - How dependent is success on current owner's presence?  
⚠️ **Equipment age** - 10-year-old kitchen may need capital investment  

**Critical Due Diligence:**
1. 3 years of tax returns (verify revenue and profitability)
2. Lease review (terms, transfer approval, rent amount)
3. Liquor license transferability (Chicago can be restrictive)
4. Staff retention plan (who are key employees?)
5. Equipment inspection (condition, replacement timeline)

---

## Opportunities for Improvement

**Quick Wins (0-6 months):**
- Add seasonal specials (customers requesting menu refresh)
- Expand wine list (common pain point, high-margin opportunity)
- Optimize staffing for peak hours (fix service speed complaints)
- Social media activation (underutilized marketing channel)

**Growth Potential (6-18 months):**
- Private events & catering (new revenue stream)
- Delivery optimization (grow from ~15% to 25-30%)
- Lunch business expansion (underutilized daytime capacity)
- Loyalty program (increase customer frequency)

**Realistic Upside:** 10-20% revenue growth through optimization, 2-3% margin improvement

---

## Valuation & Pricing

**Asking Price:** $450,000  
**Revenue Multiple:** 0.53x (asking price ÷ $850K revenue)  
**Industry Standard:** 0.4x - 0.6x for independent restaurants

**Fair Value Estimate:** $380,000 - $420,000

**Why Lower?**
- Unverified financials (discount until proven)
- High competition (market saturation risk)
- Operational improvements needed (service speed, menu)
- Equipment age (likely capital investment required)

**Offer Strategy:**
- Start at $380K (0.45x revenue)
- Walk-away price: $420K (0.49x revenue)
- Negotiate based on financial verification and equipment condition

---

## Who Should Buy This?

### ✅ Good Fit
- Experienced restaurant operator (3+ years)
- Comfortable in competitive Chicago market
- Hands-on owner (not passive investor)
- Has $100-150K for working capital + improvements

### ❌ Not a Good Fit
- First-time restaurant buyer (too competitive)
- Passive investor (requires active management)
- Looking for rapid growth (mature market)
- Risk-averse (thin margins, high competition)

---

## Bottom Line

Luigi's is a **solid, stable neighborhood restaurant** with a 10-year track record in a great location. It's not broken, but it's plateaued and needs fresh energy. The business works — it just needs an experienced operator to optimize operations, refresh the menu, and compete aggressively in a saturated market.

**This is an income play** (owner salary + modest profit), **not a growth play.**

### Recommendation: **PROCEED WITH DUE DILIGENCE** ✅

**Move forward IF:**
- Financials verify $850K revenue
- You can negotiate to $380-420K
- Lease is favorable (5+ years, reasonable rent)
- You're an experienced operator

**Walk away IF:**
- Financials don't verify
- Price stays above $420K
- Lease issues or liquor license problems
- You're a first-time restaurant buyer

---

## Next Steps

1. Request 3 years of tax returns + monthly P&Ls
2. Visit the restaurant 2-3 times (peak & off-peak hours)
3. Request lease agreement for attorney review
4. Make contingent offer: $380K pending verification
5. Engage CPA and restaurant attorney for due diligence
