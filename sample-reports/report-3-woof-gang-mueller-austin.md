**Google Trends Data:** DATA NOT AVAILABLE (not searched due to time constraints)

**Industry Headwinds:**

- ⚠️ **Labor shortage:** Skilled groomers in high demand, wage pressure
- ⚠️ **Mobile grooming competition:** Convenience factor attracting customers
- ⚠️ **DIY trends:** Some owners shift to at-home grooming during economic downturns

### Opportunity Assessment

**Potential Upside:**

1. **Capacity Expansion:**
   - If grooming booked out 2-3 weeks, hire additional groomer to increase throughput
   - Extend hours (earlier mornings, later evenings for working professionals)
   - Add Sunday hours (currently only 10am-4pm, limited)

2. **Retail Growth:**
   - Woof Gang's proprietary treat/bakery line provides margin advantage
   - Expand product selection in high-margin categories (premium toys, accessories)
   - Online ordering/local delivery (capture customers beyond walk-in range)

3. **Service Additions:**
   - Mobile grooming van (franchise may allow as add-on)
   - Daycare/boarding (requires additional space/licensing)
   - Training classes (leverage space during off-peak hours)

4. **Marketing Optimization:**
   - 732 Instagram followers is low for 7-year business; invest in social media
   - Loyalty program/membership model (monthly grooming subscription)
   - Corporate partnerships (groom employees' dogs at nearby offices)

5. **Mueller Neighborhood Growth:**
   - Final phases of Mueller development adding more residential
   - Increased foot traffic = more walk-in retail sales

**Risks:**

1. **Franchise Dependency:**
   - ⚠️ Limited operational flexibility (pricing, products, branding controlled by franchisor)
   - ⚠️ Ongoing royalties reduce profitability
   - ⚠️ Franchise could raise fees, reduce support, or enforce unfavorable terms

2. **Key Person Risk:**
   - ⚠️ If "Melissa" (named groomer) leaves, could lose customers
   - ⚠️ Need to verify groomer retention plan

3. **Lease Risk:**
   - ⚠️ Mueller retail space is premium-priced; lease expiration/renewal is critical
   - ⚠️ Landlord consent for business transfer required

4. **Market Saturation:**
   - ⚠️ Austin has 15+ high-quality groomers; new entrants could pressure margins
   - ⚠️ PetSmart in same neighborhood offers budget alternative

5. **Economic Downturn:**
   - ⚠️ 2025-2026 recession risk could reduce grooming frequency and retail spending

## 7. VALUATION CONSIDERATIONS

### Valuation Without Financial Data

**CRITICAL LIMITATION:** Asking price and financial performance data are NOT publicly available. The following analysis is speculative based on industry benchmarks.

### Industry Valuation Benchmarks

**Pet Grooming/Retail Business Multiples:**
- **Revenue multiple:** 0.5x - 1.5x annual gross revenue
- **SDE (Seller's Discretionary Earnings) multiple:** 2.0x - 4.0x SDE
- **EBITDA multiple:** 3.0x - 5.0x EBITDA (if manager-run, not owner-operated)

**Factors Increasing Valuation:**
- ✅ Franchise affiliation (systems, brand, lower buyer risk)
- ✅ Prime location (Mueller neighborhood)
- ✅ Strong online reputation (4.8 stars)
- ✅ Established customer base (7 years operating)
- ✅ Diversified revenue (grooming + retail)

**Factors Decreasing Valuation:**
- ⚠️ Franchise royalties (reduce cash flow to owner)
- ⚠️ Lease dependency (no real estate included)
- ⚠️ Key employee risk (if "Melissa" critical to business)
- ⚠️ Young business (only 7 years, not 15-20 year established business)

### Hypothetical Valuation Scenarios

**Scenario A: High Performer**
Assumptions:
- Gross Revenue: $800,000/year
- SDE: $200,000 (25% margin after owner salary)
- Multiple: 3.0x SDE
- **Estimated Value:** $600,000

**Scenario B: Average Performer**
Assumptions:
- Gross Revenue: $500,000/year
- SDE: $100,000 (20% margin)
- Multiple: 2.5x SDE
- **Estimated Value:** $250,000

**Scenario C: Below Average**
Assumptions:
- Gross Revenue: $300,000/year
- SDE: $60,000 (20% margin)
- Multiple: 2.0x SDE
- **Estimated Value:** $120,000

### Financing Considerations

**SBA 7(a) Loan Potential:**
- Franchise businesses generally qualify for SBA loans
- Woof Gang Bakery & Grooming on SBA Franchise Directory: **[VERIFY REQUIRED]**
- Typical terms: 10% down, 90% financed at ~8-10% interest, 10-year term
- **Requirement:** Business must demonstrate debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 1.25x minimum

**Seller Financing:**
- Common in franchise resales
- Typical: 20-30% seller note, 3-5 year term, 6-8% interest
- Shows seller confidence in business sustainability

### Red Flags for Valuation:

❌ **If asking price >4x SDE** - overpriced unless exceptional circumstances
❌ **If revenue declining YoY** - market saturation or operational issues
❌ **If high customer churn** - reputation eroding despite old reviews
❌ **If key employee (Melissa) leaving** - may lose 20-40% of customers

---

## 8. FINAL RECOMMENDATION

### Risk Level: ⚠️ **MODERATE** (pending financial disclosure)

**CONDITIONAL RECOMMENDATION: Investigate Further**

This business has strong qualitative indicators (reputation, location, franchise support), but **CANNOT BE EVALUATED WITHOUT FINANCIAL DATA**. Proceed with the following approach:

### Step 1: Request Financial Package (Immediately)

Contact seller/broker and request:
1. Last 3 years tax returns
2. Last 24 months P&L statements
3. Asking price and terms
4. Franchise Agreement (for review)

**If seller refuses or delays providing financials → WALK AWAY**

### Step 2: Benchmark Financials (Once Received)

**Red Flags to Walk Away:**
- ❌ Revenue declining >10% YoY
- ❌ SDE margin <15% (after owner market-rate salary)
- ❌ Asking price >4x SDE without real estate
- ❌ Debt service coverage ratio <1.25x with standard loan terms
- ❌ Franchise fees >8% of gross revenue
- ❌ Lease expiring within 2 years without renewal option

**Green Lights to Proceed:**
- ✅ Revenue growing 5-10% YoY
- ✅ SDE margin 20-25%+
- ✅ Asking price 2.5-3.5x SDE
- ✅ DSCR >1.5x
- ✅ Lease has 5+ years remaining or renewal option
- ✅ Key employee (Melissa) willing to stay with retention bonus

### Step 3: Franchise Evaluation

**Contact Woof Gang Bakery & Grooming Corporate:**
- Request Item 19 from FDD (financial performance representations)
- Ask about average unit volume (AUV) for similar markets
- Verify franchise transfer fees and approval timeline
- Speak to 3-5 other franchisees (required by FDD)

**Questions for Other Franchisees:**
1. Actual vs. projected revenue in first 3 years?
2. What are your royalty and marketing fees (% of gross)?
3. Franchisor support quality (training, marketing, supply chain)?
4. Any regrets or red flags?
5. Would you buy this franchise again?

### This Deal Makes Sense For:

✅ **Experienced pet industry professional** - groomer, vet tech, pet store manager seeking ownership

✅ **Semi-absentee owner** - if staffed with competent groomers/manager (verify feasibility with current staffing)

✅ **Buyer wanting franchise systems** - reduces risk vs. starting independent grooming salon

✅ **Mueller resident/Austin local** - understands market, can leverage personal network

✅ **Investor with pet industry operator** - passive investor + active manager partnership

### This Deal Does NOT Make Sense For:

❌ **First-time business buyer with no pet industry experience** - steep learning curve, franchise rules limit flexibility

❌ **Buyer requiring immediate cash flow >$100K/year** - unless financials prove this (unlikely for 7-year-old small grooming salon)

❌ **Buyer seeking full creative control** - franchise constraints limit autonomy

❌ **Buyer unwilling to work weekends** - pet grooming requires Saturday availability

### Positive Factors Worth Pursuing:

- ✅ **4.8-star reputation** - strong foundation to build on
- ✅ **Mueller location** - one of Austin's best neighborhoods
- ✅ **Franchise support** - training, marketing, systems reduce startup risk vs. independent
- ✅ **Diversified revenue** - retail sales provide stability when grooming demand fluctuates
- ✅ **Growing market** - Austin population +1-2% YoY, pet ownership increasing
- ✅ **Named groomer asset** - "Melissa" reputation is valuable (if retained)
- ✅ **Established 7 years** - survived COVID, has loyal customer base

### Negotiation Strategy:

1. **Use lack of social media presence as leverage** - 732 Instagram followers for 7-year business suggests missed growth opportunities
2. **Key employee risk** - if "Melissa" not locked in with contract, negotiate lower price
3. **Franchise constraints** - royalties reduce profitability; justify lower multiple vs. independent shop
4. **Lease uncertainty** - if <3 years remaining, negotiate price reduction or seller pays for lease extension
5. **Market comp data** - mystery shop 3-5 competitors to validate pricing and service quality
