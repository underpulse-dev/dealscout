## Risks & Red Flags

### Critical Concerns

⚠️ **NO ACTIVE SALE LISTING**  
This business is not currently listed for sale on any broker platforms. This report assumes hypothetical interest in acquiring a Woof Gang franchise or this specific location.

**Paths to Acquisition:**
1. **Contact current owner** — Directly inquire if owner is interested in selling
2. **Contact Woof Gang Bakery corporate** — Inquire about franchise resales or new franchise opportunities in Austin
3. **Wait for listing** — Monitor BizBuySell, LoopNet, and franchise resale sites

⚠️ **FRANCHISE DEPENDENCY**  
As a franchisee, buyer is subject to:
- Ongoing royalty fees (typically 5-8% of gross sales)
- Marketing fund contributions (1-3%)
- Required product sourcing from approved vendors
- Franchise agreement terms (typically 10-year initial term)
- Potential territory restrictions

**Questions for franchisor:**
- What are current royalty and marketing fee structures?
- Can franchise agreement be transferred to new owner?
- Are there any territorial exclusivity protections?
- What are renewal terms and fees?

⚠️ **PETSMART PROXIMITY**  
PetSmart location 0.3 miles away creates direct price competition. Budget-conscious customers may shop PetSmart for products and only use Woof Gang for grooming.

**Mitigation:** Focus on premium product differentiation and superior customer service.

⚠️ **STAFFING RISK (GROOMER DEPENDENCY)**  
Reddit and reviews specifically mention groomer "Melissa" by name. If Melissa leaves, business could lose customers.

**Questions for owner:**
- How many groomers currently employed?
- What is groomer retention rate?
- Are there non-compete agreements with key staff?
- What is average client waitlist for grooming appointments?

⚠️ **LIMITED FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY**  
Without seller financials or franchise disclosure, it's impossible to assess:
- Actual revenue and profitability
- Customer acquisition cost
- Average transaction value
- Grooming vs. retail revenue split
- Seasonal fluctuations

**Required Due Diligence:**
- Request 3 years of tax returns (if owner selling)
- Obtain Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD) from Woof Gang corporate
- Review Item 19 (Financial Performance Representations) in FDD to compare location performance to system averages

### Operational Risks

- **Retail inventory management** — Perishable raw pet food requires careful inventory control to minimize waste
- **Grooming liability** — Pet injury risk requires proper insurance and trained staff
- **Lease terms** — Mueller is a managed development; lease rates may be higher than typical retail space
- **Weather/seasonal** — While Austin climate is generally favorable, extreme heat or winter storms could impact foot traffic

### Market Risks

- **Economic downturn** — Premium pet services are discretionary; recession could drive customers to lower-cost alternatives
- **E-commerce competition** — Chewy, Amazon, and direct-to-consumer pet food brands compete for product sales
- **Franchise saturation** — Multiple Woof Gang locations in Austin could dilute brand impact

- ❌ Buyers uncomfortable with franchise restrictions (product sourcing, branding, etc.)

**Recommended Next Steps:**

1. **Contact Woof Gang Bakery Corporate:**  
   - Request Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD)  
   - Inquire about franchise resale opportunities or availability of this location  
   - Review Item 19 (Financial Performance Representations) to understand typical location economics

   - Mystery shop PetSmart Mueller to assess competitive positioning  
   - Review grooming appointment availability (long waitlists = strong demand)  

4. **Financial Modeling:**  
   - Request anonymized financials from Woof Gang corporate (average franchise performance)  
   - Build pro forma P&L based on estimated grooming revenue ($100-150K/year per groomer) + retail sales  
   - Factor in franchise fees (assume 6% royalty + 2% marketing = 8% of gross sales)  

5. **Alternative Path — Open New Franchise:**  
   If this location is not available for purchase, consider:  
   - Opening a new Woof Gang franchise in an underserved Austin suburb (Pflugerville, Round Rock, Bee Cave)

This is a **rare combination** of:
- ✅ Affluent, growing neighborhood  
- ✅ Proven franchise brand

For the right buyer with pet industry experience and franchise capital, this could be a **high-quality, cash-flowing asset** with strong growth potential.
