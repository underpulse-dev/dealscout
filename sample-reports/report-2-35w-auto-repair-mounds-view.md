## Executive Summary

35W Auto Repair & Wash is a family-owned auto repair shop with a self-service car wash, established in 2002. The business is located directly off Interstate 35W in Mounds View, Minnesota, offering high visibility and easy access. **This is a real estate included opportunity** — the $1.6M asking price includes the land and building (4,152 sq ft), making it attractive for owner-operators seeking long-term control and equity building. The seller cites retirement as the reason for selling after 20+ years of operation.

**Quick Verdict:** ✅ **MODERATE OPPORTUNITY** — Solid fundamentals with real estate, but low net income relative to asking price warrants scrutiny of financials.

### Car Wash Competitors

**Tommy's Express** (Mounds View) — Express car wash chain  
📎 Verify: [Yellow Pages - Mounds View car washes](https://www.yellowpages.com/mounds-view-mn/auto-repair) — See car wash listings

**Competitive Density:** Moderate — multiple auto repair shops in area, typical for suburban market. Self-service car wash addition provides differentiation.

**Market Saturation Analysis:**  
Population 12,992 ÷ ~10 auto repair shops = ~1,300 residents per shop. This is a healthy ratio for an affluent suburb with high vehicle ownership.

---

## Opportunities

### Strategic Advantages

1. **Real Estate Ownership** — Buyer gains long-term control, builds equity, and eliminates lease risk. Real estate alone may represent $1M+ of the $1.6M asking price.
2. **Interstate Visibility** — Direct access from I-35W provides consistent drive-by exposure and easy customer access
3. **Dual Revenue Streams** — Auto repair (labor-intensive, high margin) + car wash (passive, weather-resistant income)
4. **Established Customer Base** — 24 years of operation implies loyal, repeat customers
5. **Affluent Demographics** — Median household income of $90K+ supports premium service pricing

### Growth Potential

**Immediate Improvements:**
- **Hire mechanics** — Current zero-employee model limits capacity. Adding 1-2 mechanics could double revenue.
- **Digital marketing** — Build Google/Yelp reviews, launch local SEO, and create social media presence
- **Expand services** — Add detailing, tire sales, or state inspections
- **Upgrade car wash** — Modernize equipment or add automatic bay for premium pricing

**Long-Term Opportunities:**
- **Fleet contracts** — Target local businesses for fleet maintenance
- **Subscription car wash** — Monthly unlimited wash memberships for recurring revenue
- **Real estate play** — Hold property, grow business, sell at higher multiple in 5-10 years

## Risks & Red Flags

### Critical Concerns

🚩 **HIGH ASKING PRICE vs. NET INCOME**  
$1.6M asking price against $171K net income = 9.3-year payback. Most buyers target 5-7 years. This suggests:
- Real estate value is driving the price (not just business operations)
- Buyer needs to verify if $171K is truly discretionary earnings or includes owner salary

**Questions for broker/seller:**
- What portion of the $1.6M is allocated to real estate vs. business operations?
- What is the breakdown of the $171K "Total Income"? (Owner salary + profit?)
- What are the actual net profits after a market-rate salary for the owner?

🚩 **ZERO EMPLOYEES**  
Owner operates alone (no staff listed). This means:
- Business is 100% dependent on owner's technical skills and labor
- Buyer must be an experienced mechanic OR hire immediately
- No business continuity if owner leaves

**Questions for seller:**
- Does the owner work full-time? How many hours per week?
- Are there any contract/part-time workers not disclosed?
- What is the customer appointment volume (how many cars/week)?

🚩 **REVENUE DISCREPANCY WITH FACILITY SIZE**  
$372K gross revenue for a 3-bay shop + 4-bay car wash seems low. Industry benchmarks:
- Auto repair shops average $150-200K revenue per bay per year
- 3 bays should generate $450-600K+ in repair revenue alone
- Car wash revenue not separately disclosed

**This suggests:**
- Owner may not be working full capacity (retirement mode?)
- Significant upside if buyer increases hours/efficiency
- OR: Equipment/facility condition may limit throughput

🚩 **30-YEAR vs. 24-YEAR CLAIM**  
Website says "30 years of excellence" but broker says "established 2002" (24 years ago). Possible explanations:
- Business existed before 2002 at different location?
- Owner worked in industry for 30 years but opened this shop in 2002?
- Exaggeration for marketing purposes?

**Requires clarification** — inconsistencies raise due diligence concerns.

🚩 **LIMITED ONLINE REVIEWS**  
Very few reviews on Yelp, Google, and other platforms despite 24 years of operation. This could mean:
- Older, less tech-savvy customer base
- Limited marketing efforts
- Opportunity to build reputation (positive spin)
- OR: Lack of customer satisfaction (negative spin)

### Operational Risks

- **Real estate appraisal needed** — Verify actual market value of land + building
- **Equipment condition** — $75K equipment value seems low for 3 bays. Hoists, diagnostic tools, compressors may need replacement soon.
- **Environmental compliance** — Auto shops have EPA/state regulations for waste oil, fluids, etc. Ensure compliance and no violations.
- **Zoning** — Verify zoning allows continued auto repair + car wash use

### Market Risks

- **Economic downturn** — Auto repair is somewhat recession-resistant, but luxury services (car wash, non-essential repairs) may decline
- **Electric vehicle shift** — EVs require less maintenance (no oil changes, fewer brake jobs). Long-term trend to monitor.
- **Competition** — Multiple auto shops in area; need strong differentiation

## Verdict

✅ **PROCEED WITH CAUTION — STRONG POTENTIAL FOR RIGHT BUYER**

This opportunity has solid fundamentals but requires the **right buyer profile** to succeed:

**Ideal Buyer:**
- ✅ Experienced auto mechanic or shop manager
- ✅ Can work full-time in the business (at least initially)
- ✅ Has $1.28M+ cash for down payment OR strong lender relationships
- ✅ Sees value in real estate ownership and long-term equity building
- ✅ Comfortable with slow-growth, stable business model

**NOT Ideal For:**
- ❌ Absentee/investor buyers (zero employees = owner must work)
- ❌ First-time business buyers without auto repair experience
- ❌ Buyers expecting fast ROI or aggressive growth without additional investment

**Key Questions to Answer Before Proceeding:**

1. **Financial verification:**
   - Request 3 years of tax returns (Schedule C or corporate returns)
   - Get profit & loss statements with owner compensation clearly separated
   - Verify gross revenue matches tax filings

2. **Real estate valuation:**
   - Order independent appraisal of land + building
   - Confirm allocation of $1.6M (how much is real estate vs. business goodwill?)

3. **Operational capacity:**
   - How many customers/cars serviced per week?
   - What are current operating hours?
   - Why is revenue per bay below industry average?

4. **Transition plan:**
   - Will seller provide 1 month training (per listing)?
   - Will seller introduce buyer to customer base?
   - Are customer records and contact information included?

5. **Equipment audit:**
   - On-site inspection of all equipment with a mechanic
   - Verify no deferred maintenance or imminent capital expenditures

**Recommended Next Steps:**

1. Contact broker (Joseph McKeown, License #40913077) via FCBB to request financials and schedule site visit  
   📎 Verify: [Contact form](https://fcbb.com/listing-property/auto-mounds-view-35w-auto-repair-and-car-wash-235-24729) — Request information

2. Drive to location and assess visibility, condition, and neighborhood during business hours

3. Request customer testimonials or references from regular clients

4. Consult with commercial real estate appraiser for property valuation

5. Review environmental compliance records with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency

**Bottom Line:** This is a **real estate + business hybrid deal**. If the building and land alone appraise for $1.2-1.4M, then the business is essentially a low-cost add-on with $171K+ annual cash flow. For a mechanic seeking to own their workspace and build equity, this could be an excellent long-term play. For a pure business investor, the numbers are marginal without capacity expansion.

**DealScout Risk Score:** ⚠️ MODERATE — Good fundamentals, but requires significant due diligence and right buyer fit.
