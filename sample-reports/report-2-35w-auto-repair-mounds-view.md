### Review Summary

| Platform | Rating | Review Count | Status | Source |
|----------|--------|--------------|--------|--------|
| Google | DATA NOT AVAILABLE | Positive review quoted | Active | [35wautorepairandwash.com](https://35wautorepairandwash.com/) |
| Yelp | DATA NOT AVAILABLE | Mentioned in area search | Active | [Yelp Search](https://yelp.com/search?cflt=carwash&find_loc=Moundsview+Boulevard) |

**Overall Rating Estimate:** DATA NOT AVAILABLE - insufficient online review data

### Sentiment Analysis

**Positive Themes** (based on limited available data):
- "Very honest (charging less, when he quoted more)" - Google review on business website
- "Dependable (always ready when he says it'll be ready)" - Google review
- "Charged less than a dealer" - Google review
- "Fast, honest service" - Business description
- "Built a reputation for fast, honest service" - Broker listing

**Negative Themes:**
- No negative reviews found in public search results

**Critical Risk Signal:** The near-complete lack of online reviews is a significant red flag for a business that has been operating since 2002. This suggests either:
1. Very low customer volume
2. Minimal repeat/referral business generating online feedback
3. No active effort to solicit reviews or build online presence
4. Primarily cash-based walk-in clientele

For a business claiming 22+ years of operation, the absence of substantial online reputation data requires investigation during due diligence.

### Competitive Assessment

**Market Saturation:** MODERATE - The northern Minneapolis metro area has multiple auto repair options, but not as saturated as urban cores. The business serves a defined geographic area around I-35W.

**Differentiation:** 35W Auto Repair differentiates through:
- **Self-service car wash** component (4 bays) - additional revenue stream
- **Interstate visibility** - located right off I-35W for high traffic exposure
- **Established presence** - 22+ years builds trust in automotive market
- **Owner-operated** - personal service, though limits scale

**Competitive Disadvantage:**
- **Minimal online presence** - competitors with strong Yelp/Google profiles have marketing edge
- **No employees** - limits capacity and operating hours flexibility
- **Generic branding** - unlike franchises (e.g., car wash chains), no brand recognition
- **Limited services** - no mention of specialized services (diesel, European, etc.)

**Competitive Advantage:**
- **Real estate ownership** - not burdened by rent increases, can't be displaced
- **Dual revenue streams** - auto repair + car wash diversification
- **Highway access** - I-35W location captures transient traffic

## 4. BUSINESS VERIFICATION & RISK FLAGS

### Operational Status: ✅ **VERIFIED ACTIVE**

**Confirmed Operating:**
- Website active and functioning: 35wautorepairandwash.com
- Phone number listed: (763) 785-4700
- Business hours and services actively marketed
- Social media presence (Twitter/X account from 2015, minimal activity)

### Financial Claims Verification

**Listed Financials (from FCBB Listing #24729):**
- Gross Revenue: $372,064
- Total Income (SDE): $171,340
- Equipment/Fixtures Value: $75,000
- Inventory: $30,000

**Analysis:**
- **SDE Margin:** $171,340 / $372,064 = 46% - **STRONG for owner-operated business**
- **Revenue per square foot:** $372,064 / 4,152 sq ft = $89.61/sq ft - low for auto repair
- **Asking Price Multiple:** $1.6M / $171,340 SDE = 9.34x - **HIGH, driven by real estate value**

**Red Flags Requiring Verification:**
1. **Zero employees** - Who operates when owner is absent? How are hours limited?
2. **No lease cost ($0 rent)** - Confirms owned real estate, but verify property taxes, insurance
3. **Low inventory ($30K)** - Suggests limited parts stocking, may source as-needed
4. **"Established in 2002"** but website says "over 30 years" serving area - clarify history
5. **Low revenue for facility size** - 4,152 sq ft generating $372K suggests underutilization

## 5. MARKET TRENDS & OPPORTUNITY

### Industry Trends

**Auto Repair Industry - Minnesota Market:**

DATA NOT AVAILABLE from search results:
- Minnesota auto repair industry growth rates
- Electric vehicle penetration in Mounds View area (impacts future service demand)
- Average revenue per shop in Minnesota
- Industry benchmarks for auto repair revenue/sq ft

**Inferred Trends:**
- ✅ **High car ownership (2 cars/household)** = strong baseline demand
- ✅ **Aging vehicle fleet nationally** = more repairs needed vs. new car purchases
- ⚠️ **EV adoption** = future risk for traditional ICE repair shops (though Minnesota EV penetration still low)
- ✅ **Supply chain** = people keeping cars longer post-2020 chip shortage = more repair work

**Car Wash Industry:**
- Self-service car wash market stable but not growing significantly
- Competition from automatic washes and mobile detailing
- Winter months in Minnesota = reduced car wash demand (Nov-March)
- Salt/road chemical use in winter = year-round cleaning need for vehicle preservation

### Opportunity Assessment

**Potential Upside:**
- ✅ **Real Estate Appreciation:** $294,500 median home value (+7.76% YoY) suggests rising property values; land alone may justify significant portion of $1.6M price
- ✅ **Capacity Expansion:** Zero employees = opportunity to hire and increase revenue significantly
- ✅ **Digital Marketing:** Near-zero online presence = untapped customer acquisition channel
- ✅ **Service Expansion:** Add specializations (diesel, European, hybrid/EV) to capture niche markets
- ✅ **Fleet Services:** Target local businesses (construction companies, delivery services) for B2B revenue
- ✅ **Extended Hours:** Owner-operated limits hours; employees enable evening/Saturday service
- ✅ **Upgrade Car Wash:** Modernize to touchless automatic system for higher revenue per customer

**Risks:**
- ⚠️ **Declining Population:** -0.824% YoY = shrinking local customer base
- ⚠️ **Economic Pressure:** Rising poverty rate suggests potential belt-tightening on auto maintenance
- ⚠️ **Valuation Risk:** 9.34x SDE multiple is extremely high unless real estate appraisal supports land/building value of $1.2M-$1.3M
- ⚠️ **Environmental Liability:** Auto repair and car wash operations require EPA compliance; any soil contamination (oil, fuel) could create massive liability
- ⚠️ **Solo Operator Dependency:** All revenue tied to one person's labor; no systems, no team
- ⚠️ **Revenue Stagnation:** No data showing growth; may be declining business being sold before further deterioration

## 7. VALUATION CONSIDERATIONS

### Valuation Breakdown

**Scenario 1: Real Estate Justifies Asking Price**

If independent appraisal values property at $1.3M-$1.5M:
- Land + Building: $1,300,000 (assumed)
- Business (3x SDE): $514,020
- **Total Value:** $1,814,020
- **Asking Price:** $1,600,000
- **Conclusion:** Fair deal IF property value confirmed

**Scenario 2: Real Estate Worth Less**

If property appraises at $800K (more typical for 4,152 sq ft industrial in suburban MN):
- Land + Building: $800,000
- Business (3x SDE): $514,020
- **Total Value:** $1,314,020
- **Asking Price:** $1,600,000
- **Conclusion:** Overpriced by ~$286K (18%)

**Business Valuation (Excluding Real Estate):**
- **SDE Multiple Method:** $171,340 x 3.0 = $514,020
- **Revenue Multiple Method:** $372,064 x 1.5 = $558,096
- **Asset Value:** Equipment $75K + Inventory $30K = $105,000 (floor value)

**Industry Valuation Benchmarks:**
- Auto repair shops typically sell for 2.5-4x SDE
- 3x SDE is market average for owner-operated shops
- Real estate significantly increases valuation

### Financing Considerations

**Down Payment:** Listing shows $1,280,000 (80% down) required

**SBA 7(a) Loan Potential:**
- Real estate component: potentially 90% LTV (10% down on property value)
- Business component: typically 10-20% down
- **Challenge:** Low revenue makes debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) tight
- Assume $1.6M loan at 8% over 25 years = ~$12,335/month
- SDE of $171,340 / 12 = $14,278/month - **barely covers debt service**
- Adding owner salary need, DSCR is likely BELOW 1.25x required by most lenders

**Seller Financing:**
- Not mentioned in listing
- Recommend negotiating seller note for 10-20% of purchase price

---

## 8. FINAL RECOMMENDATION

### Risk Level: ⚠️ **MODERATE-HIGH**

**PROCEED WITH CAUTION** - This deal is ONLY viable if:

1. **Independent property appraisal confirms value >$1.2M**
2. **Phase I ESA shows no environmental contamination**
3. **Buyer has significant cash (down payment >$400K) OR can negotiate seller financing**
4. **Buyer has auto repair experience and plans to operate hands-on**
5. **Buyer has strategy to increase revenue (hiring staff, marketing, extended hours)**

### Deal Structure Recommendations:

**Option A: Investor/Operator with Growth Plan**
- Negotiate to $1.4M if property appraises lower
- Plan to hire 1-2 ASE-certified technicians within 6 months
- Implement digital marketing (Google Ads, Yelp, social media)
- Target revenue growth to $600K+ in Year 2 to justify valuation

**Option B: Real Estate Play**
- If property appraises at or above $1.5M, this is a real estate acquisition with a business included
- Consider converting to higher-value use if auto repair doesn't scale (storage units, retail, redevelopment)
- Interstate frontage has significant value for signage/visibility

### Positive Factors:

- ✅ **Owned real estate** - no landlord risk, no rent increases
- ✅ **Established business** - 22+ years demonstrates viability
- ✅ **Strategic location** - I-35W visibility and access
- ✅ **Dual revenue streams** - auto repair + car wash diversification
- ✅ **High SDE margin** - 46% indicates efficient owner-operated model
- ✅ **Growing home values** - +7.76% YoY suggests appreciating real estate market
- ✅ **High household income** - $90,148 median supports premium pricing

### This Deal Makes Sense For:

- **Experienced auto repair technician** looking to own vs. work for someone else
- **Real estate investor** who sees property value exceeding $1.2M and can operate or lease the business
- **Semi-retired mechanic** wanting a lifestyle business (maintain current low-volume model)
- **Buyer with growth vision** willing to invest in staff, marketing, and modernization

### Walk Away If:

- ❌ Property appraises below $1.0M
- ❌ Phase I ESA shows soil/groundwater contamination (could cost $100K-$500K to remediate)
- ❌ Seller cannot provide 3+ years of tax returns and bank statements
- ❌ You need the business to immediately cash-flow debt service (revenue too low currently)
- ❌ You have no auto repair experience and can't evaluate equipment condition
- ❌ You cannot secure financing with reasonable debt service coverage

### Negotiation Leverage:

1. **Low revenue justifies lower business valuation** - focus on property value
2. **Zero online reviews** - demonstrates lack of brand value
3. **No employees = no systems** - buyer builds everything from scratch
4. **Declining population** - market headwinds
5. **Seller motivation: retirement** - may accept lower price for clean exit
