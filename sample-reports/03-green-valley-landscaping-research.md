## Seasonal Revenue Pattern (Estimated)

|-------|-----------|-------|
| Jan-Feb | 9% | Peak season, snowbird residents |
| Mar-Apr | 12% | Highest demand, spring projects |
| May | 10% | Still strong |
| Jun-Aug | 5% | Dead season, extreme heat |
| Sep-Oct | 11% | Fall projects, pleasant weather |
| Nov-Dec | 8% | Holiday slowdown |

**Critical:** Must understand seasonal cash flow management. Slow summer requires 2-3 months operating capital.

## Overall Assessment

**Risk Rating:** MEDIUM 🟡

**Summary:** Green Valley Landscaping is a **solid service business** with excellent reputation (4.6★), 14-year track record, and 60-70% recurring revenue from maintenance contracts. The business serves premium areas (Scottsdale, Paradise Valley) which provides pricing power.

**Key Challenges:**
- **Owner-dependent operations** - Success tied to owner's quality oversight
- **Seasonal cash flow** - Summer slump requires reserves
- **Labor management** - Finding/keeping good crew is ongoing challenge
- **Low barriers = high competition** - Constant price pressure from new entrants

**Key Strengths:**
- Recurring revenue base (60-70% maintenance contracts)
- Premium market positioning (affluent areas)
- Long track record (14 years = credibility)
- Equipment included (reduces startup capital need)

**Ideal Buyer Profile:**
- Landscaping industry experience (understands operations)
- Bilingual (English/Spanish) helpful for crew management
- Strong operations mindset (scheduling, routing, quality control)
- Capital reserves for seasonal cash flow gaps
- Comfortable working outdoors, hands-on in early months

**Price Assessment:** $380K asking price on $640K revenue = 0.59x multiple. Landscaping businesses typically sell for 0.5x-0.7x revenue depending on recurring contracts and equipment. **Offer range: $320K-$360K** depending on:
- % of revenue from recurring contracts (higher % = higher value)
- Equipment condition
- Customer concentration
- Owner transition plan

**Recommendation:** SOLID OPPORTUNITY FOR EXPERIENCED OPERATOR - This is a fundamentally sound service business with real cash flow and assets (equipment, customer contracts). Unlike retail or restaurants, landscaping has better margins and recurring revenue. **Best opportunity of the three sample businesses** - IF buyer has industry experience and can manage seasonal cash flow.
