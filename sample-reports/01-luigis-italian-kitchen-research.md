## Risk Assessment

### Reputation Risks: LOW-MEDIUM
- ✅ Strong overall ratings (4.2/5.0)
- ✅ No major controversies or health violations found
- ⚠️ Service speed complaints during peak times (staffing issue?)
- ✅ Owner engaged with customers (responds to reviews)

### Market Risks: MEDIUM-HIGH
- ⚠️ **High competition** - Saturated market in Lakeview
- ⚠️ **Post-pandemic shifts** - Changing dining habits, delivery competition
- ⚠️ **Chicago population decline** - Slow but steady outmigration

- ⚠️ **Peak capacity issues** - Service complaints suggest staffing/kitchen bottlenecks
- ✅ **10-year track record** - Survived pandemic, has loyal base

### Financial Risks: MEDIUM

- ⚠️ **Thin margins** - Restaurant industry typically 3-5% net margin
- ⚠️ **Verification needed** - Revenue figures need verification via tax returns
- ⚠️ **Equipment age** - 10-year-old equipment may need capital investment

6. **Lunch Business** - Potential to grow weekday lunch traffic

## Due Diligence Priorities

1. **Financial verification** - 3 years tax returns, P&L statements

3. **Staff interviews** - Key personnel, turnover, culture
4. **Equipment inspection** - Kitchen equipment age/condition, maintenance records
5. **Supplier contracts** - Existing relationships, pricing
6. **Licenses & permits** - Liquor license transferability, health permits
7. **Customer traffic patterns** - Peak times, seasonality, delivery mix

## Overall Assessment

**Risk Rating:** MEDIUM  
**Opportunity Rating:** MEDIUM-HIGH  

**Summary:** Luigi's Italian Kitchen is a stable, neighborhood Italian restaurant with solid fundamentals but facing typical challenges of a mature business in a saturated market. The 4.2-star rating and 10-year track record indicate operational competency and customer loyalty. However, competition is fierce, margins are thin, and the business shows signs of needing fresh energy (menu innovation, marketing, service improvements).

**Ideal Buyer Profile:**
- Experienced restaurant operator
- Comfortable in competitive Chicago market
- Has capital for modest upgrades and marketing
- Sees opportunity to modernize while keeping neighborhood charm

**Price Assessment:** $450K asking price is reasonable for a $850K revenue restaurant with strong location and brand. Comparable sales suggest 0.4-0.6x revenue multiple is standard for independent restaurants. **Offer range: $380K-$420K** depending on verified financials and lease terms.

**Recommendation:** PROCEED WITH CAUTION - Conduct thorough due diligence. Business is fundamentally sound but requires active ownership and investment to grow in a challenging market.
