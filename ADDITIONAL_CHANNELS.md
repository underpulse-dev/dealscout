# DealScout — Additional Distribution Channels

**Created:** 2026-02-12  
**Purpose:** Supplement the main distribution plan with extra communities discovered through research

---

## 🎯 High-Priority Additions

### 1. Buy Then Build Facebook Group (FREE)
**Why it's perfect:** Free community of acquisition entrepreneurs, run by Walker Deibel (author of "Buy Then Build")
- **URL:** Search Facebook for "Buy Then Build" group
- **Audience:** Aspiring business buyers, current owners, acquisition-focused entrepreneurs
- **Activity level:** Very active based on Reddit mentions
- **How to find:** Facebook search → "Buy Then Build" → Request to join
- **Post strategy:** Similar to main distribution plan, but emphasize the "screening before DD" angle
- **Timing:** Post here after SearchFunder to test engagement

### 2. Acquisition Lab Community
**Why it's relevant:** Paid community ($6K+) but has free resources and potentially open forums
- **URL:** https://acquisitionlab.com/
- **Audience:** Serious acquisition entrepreneurs (willing to pay for education)
- **Note:** Check if they have public blog comments or free tier where you can mention DealScout
- **Strategy:** May need to join to post, but worth monitoring for future partnerships

### 3. TexAgs Business Forum
**Why it's interesting:** Active forum discussing business acquisitions, BizBuySell, deal sourcing
- **URL:** https://texags.com/forums/57/ (Business forum)
- **Example thread:** https://texags.com/forums/57/topics/3374819 (Buying Small Businesses discussion)
- **Audience:** Texas-based but active acquisition discussions
- **Strategy:** Post as "new tool for buyers" similar to Reddit posts
- **Timing:** Low priority, test if main channels underperform

## 📊 Listing Site Communities (Lower Priority)

These sites are where buyers browse businesses but have limited community features:

### BizBuySell
- **No forums or discussion boards** (just listings)
- **Potential:** Contact them about being featured as a "Buyer Resource"
- **Future play:** Partner with them for cross-promotion once validated

### BizQuest, LoopNet, BusinessBrokersNet
- **Listing platforms** without active communities
- **Skip for now** unless we find community features

## 💡 Additional Ideas for Future Rounds

### Podcast Outreach

## 📋 Recommended Order (After Main Channels)

If main distribution (SearchFunder + Reddit + HN + LinkedIn) shows promise but needs more volume:

1. **Buy Then Build Facebook group** (immediate, high-quality audience)
2. **TexAgs Business Forum** (free, active discussions)
3. **LinkedIn acquisition groups** (professional network)
4. **Podcast outreach** (if Day 7 checkpoint shows strong interest)

---

## 🚨 Notes for Serg

- **Don't spread too thin:** Focus on main channels first (SearchFunder, Reddit, HN)
- **Add these only if:** Initial posts get engagement but you need more volume
- **Buy Then Build group is the standout** - free, active, perfectly aligned audience
- Most other "communities" mentioned online are paid programs ($6K-$15K) trying to sell courses, not organic forums

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Execute main distribution plan first (LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md)
2. Monitor Day 7 checkpoint results
3. If needed, add Buy Then Build FB group as Channel #6
4. Save podcast outreach for post-validation marketing
