## 🎯 General Principles

1. **Be helpful, not defensive** — Acknowledge valid concerns, provide value
2. **Be transparent about scope** — We're a screening tool, not full DD replacement
3. **Lead with value** — Every response should make them think "hmm, that's useful"
4. **No overselling** — Don't promise what we can't deliver
5. **Respond within 6 hours** — Especially on HN/Reddit where threads move fast

## Common Questions & Responses

### Q1: "How is this different from just Googling the business?"

**Short version (Reddit/HN):**
> Fair question! The difference is speed + comprehensiveness. You *could* manually search Google Reviews, Yelp, BBB, local news, demographics, competitors, market trends, etc. — but that's 3-4 hours per business. When you're screening 10-20 listings, that's 40+ hours.
> 
> DealScout does that research in 2 minutes and structures it so you can make a quick go/no-go decision. It's about **filtering efficiently** so you spend your DD budget on businesses that deserve it.
> 
> Think of it like Carfax — you wouldn't buy a car without the report, even though the info is technically public.

**Long version (SearchFunder):**
> Great question! Google is absolutely free and you should definitely use it. The value DealScout provides is:
> 
> 1. **Speed:** We aggregate data from 10+ sources (Google Reviews, Yelp, BBB, demographics, competitors, news) in 2 minutes instead of 3-4 hours per business.
> 
> 2. **Comprehensiveness:** We search places you might forget — local news archives, zoning changes, competitor analysis, market trends, social media sentiment.
> 
> 3. **Structure:** All findings organized into decision-making sections: "Red Flags," "Positive Signals," "Competitive Landscape," "Market Opportunity" — instead of scattered tabs.
> 
> 4. **Filtering at scale:** When you're screening 10-20 businesses on BizBuySell, doing this manually is 40+ hours. DealScout makes it 20 minutes.
> 
> 5. **Avoiding bias:** It's easy to get excited about a listing and miss warning signs. An objective report helps catch things emotional buyers miss.
> 
> The use case is: **screen listings before committing $15-30K to professional DD.** You wouldn't skip Googling the business — DealScout just does it faster and more thoroughly.

### Q2: "This doesn't replace real due diligence, right?"

**Response:**
> 100% correct — and we're very clear about this. DealScout covers ~15-20% of full due diligence: the **public data layer** (reputation, demographics, market, competitors).
> 
> We explicitly do NOT cover:
> - Financial statement verification
> - Legal/contract review
> - Environmental inspections
> - Franchise compliance
> - Employee/customer interviews
> 
> The goal is to help you **screen listings** before you spend $15-30K on professional DD. Think of it as "Which businesses deserve my DD budget — and which ones don't?"
> 
> Every report includes a "What To Do Next" section that says: "If this business passes initial screening, hire a CPA, attorney, and industry expert for full due diligence."

---

### Q3: "$200 seems expensive for automated research. Why not just charge $20?"

**Response:**
> I get why it seems high at first, but here's the thinking:
> 
> 1. **Time value:** If you're buying a $300K business, spending 3-4 hours researching each listing yourself = $0 cost, but significant time. If you're screening 10 businesses, that's 40 hours. At even $50/hour opportunity cost, that's $2,000. Spending $200 to do it in 20 minutes is a 10x ROI.
> 
> 2. **Compared to alternatives:** A professional background check costs $200-500 and takes 3-5 days. DealScout delivers similar breadth (public data) in 2 minutes.
> 
> 3. **Decision quality:** Missing a red flag on a bad acquisition can cost you $100K-300K. $200 to catch those flags early is cheap insurance.
> 
> 4. **Beta pricing:** We're actually offering intro pricing of $100 for full reports right now (first report per customer). Regular price will be $200.
> 
> That said, if $200 is a barrier, we also have a $20-40 "Quick Scan" option that covers just reputation + major red flags. Lightweight version for early filtering.

**Alternative (if they're really pushing back):**
> What price point would feel right to you for this kind of report? Genuinely curious — trying to find the sweet spot between "impulse buy for screening" and "serious enough to deliver value."

### Q4: "How accurate is AI-generated analysis? Can I trust this?"

**Response:**
> Great question — trust is everything for a product like this. Here's how we ensure accuracy:
> 
> 1. **Real data only:** Every data point comes from a real source (Google, Yelp, Census.gov, BBB, news sites). We cite sources in the report so you can verify.
> 
> 2. **No hallucinations:** The AI analyzes real data — it doesn't invent reviews, ratings, or demographics. If data isn't available, we say "DATA NOT AVAILABLE" instead of guessing.
> 
> 3. **Human-verifiable:** Every claim in the report links to the source. You can click through and confirm yourself.
> 
> 4. **Clear limitations:** We tell you what we DON'T cover (financials, legal, etc.) and recommend hiring professionals for those areas.
> 
> 5. **100% refund guarantee:** If the report has factual errors or doesn't deliver value, you get a full refund within 48 hours.
> 
> Think of it like this: AI doesn't replace your judgment — it just speeds up research. You still make the final call.
> 
> You can see a sample report here: [link to one of the three sample reports]. Real business, real data, real analysis.

### Q5: "What about [competitor] like BizReport or DueDilio?"

**Response (generic — adjust based on actual competitor):**
> Good catch — [competitor] is a solid option. Here's how we're different:
> 
> - **Speed:** We deliver in 2 minutes vs. 3-5 days (if they're slower)
> - **Pricing:** $100-200 vs. $XXX (if we're cheaper)
> - **Scope:** We focus on public data screening; they focus on [whatever they do differently]
> - **DIY friendly:** You get the full report immediately; no waiting for an analyst
> 
> Honestly, if [competitor] works for you, stick with it. We're trying to serve buyers who want faster, cheaper screening before they commit to deeper DD.

**If they mention a free tool:**
> You're right that [free tool] exists. The difference is:
> - We aggregate multiple sources (Google, Yelp, BBB, demographics, competitors, news) in one report
> - We structure it for decision-making (red flags, opportunities, risks)
> - We save you 3-4 hours per business
> 
> If you have time to manually compile this yourself, absolutely do it for free. DealScout is for buyers who are screening 10-20 businesses and want to move fast.

### Q6: "Can you analyze this specific business for me?" (fishing for free report)

**Response:**
> I'd love to, but I can't generate custom reports here in the thread (wouldn't be fair to paying customers). 
> 
> However, you can check out our sample reports to see exactly what you'd get:
> - [Stinkin Crawfish Restaurant (Inglewood, CA)](link)
> - [35W Auto Repair & Wash (Mounds View, MN)](link)
> - [Woof Gang Grooming (Austin, TX)](link)
> 
> If those look useful, you can order a report for any business at https://underpulse-dev.github.io/dealscout/
> 
> Alternatively, if you join the waitlist, I'll send you a discount code for your first report.

### Q7: "This sounds too good to be true. What's the catch?"

**Response:**
> No catch! But let me be clear about what this IS and ISN'T:
> 
> **What DealScout IS:**
> - Fast screening tool for public data (reviews, demographics, competitors, market trends)
> - Helps you filter listings before spending $15-30K on full DD
> - Covers ~15-20% of total due diligence (the public layer)
> 
> **What DealScout is NOT:**
> - Not a replacement for CPA, attorney, or industry expert
> - Doesn't verify financials, legal docs, or operational claims
> - Doesn't include site visits or interviews
> 
> Think of it as "Step 1" in a 3-step process:
> 1. **DealScout** (2 min) — Screen out obvious red flags
> 2. **Deep dive** (your own research) — Visit site, talk to owner, review docs
> 3. **Professional DD** ($15-30K) — CPA, attorney, industry expert
> 
> The value is in Step 1 — helping you avoid wasting time on businesses that have public red flags you'd discover later anyway.

### Q8: "Can I see a sample report before signing up?"

**Response:**
> Absolutely! We have three full sample reports:
> 
> 1. [**Stinkin Crawfish Restaurant** (Inglewood, CA)](https://underpulse-dev.github.io/dealscout/sample-reports/report-1-stinkin-crawfish-inglewood.html) — Louisiana restaurant with strong reputation
> 2. [**35W Auto Repair & Wash** (Mounds View, MN)](https://underpulse-dev.github.io/dealscout/sample-reports/report-2-35w-auto-repair-mounds-view.html) — Auto service with real estate included
> 3. [**Woof Gang Grooming** (Austin, TX)](https://underpulse-dev.github.io/dealscout/sample-reports/report-3-woof-gang-mueller-austin.html) — Pet grooming franchise
> 
> All based on real businesses with real data. Check them out and let me know what you think!

---

### Q9: "What if the report is wrong or unhelpful?"

**Response:**
> Fair concern. Here's our guarantee:
> 
> - **100% refund** if the report fails to generate or has major factual errors
> - **50% refund** within 48 hours if you're unsatisfied with the value
> - **No refund** after 48 hours or after you've downloaded the report (to prevent abuse)
> 
> Our goal is to deliver value, not trap you. If we don't, we don't deserve your money.
> 
> Also worth noting: every report cites sources, so you can verify the data yourself. If something seems off, you can check the original source (Google Reviews, Yelp, Census.gov, etc.).

### Q10: "Why should I trust a new product over established services?"

**Response:**
> Totally fair. Here's why you might give us a shot:
> 
> 1. **Sample reports are public** — You can evaluate the quality before paying. No "buy first, see what you get later."
> 
> 2. **100% refund guarantee** — If it doesn't deliver value, you're not out any money.
> 
> 3. **Lower price point** — $100-200 vs. $500-1000 for traditional services. Lower risk to try.
> 
> 4. **Speed** — 2 minutes vs. 3-5 days. If you're screening multiple businesses, speed matters.
> 
> 5. **Founder-led** — I'm building this because I saw a gap. I'm personally responding to feedback and iterating fast.
> 
> That said, if you're more comfortable with established services, totally fair. I'd rather you use something you trust than feel uncertain.
> 
> If you want to try DealScout, I can offer you a discount code for being an early tester. DM me.

### Q11: "Does this work for [industry]?" (e.g., e-commerce, SaaS, manufacturing)

**Response:**
> **For businesses with physical locations** (restaurants, retail, services): Yes, works great. We pull Google Reviews, Yelp, local demographics, foot traffic patterns, competitors.
> 
> **For e-commerce or online-only businesses:** Partial coverage. We can analyze online reputation (Trustpilot, Reddit mentions), market trends, competitive landscape — but we can't assess foot traffic or local demographics (since they don't apply).
> 
> **For SaaS or tech businesses:** Limited value. Most of what matters (product-market fit, churn, tech stack) isn't public data. Better to use traditional SaaS DD services.
> 
> **Best fit:** Main Street businesses with physical locations in the $100K-$5M range.
> 
> What industry are you looking at? I can tell you if DealScout would be useful.

---

### Q12: "Can you customize reports or add specific data sources?"

**Response (early stage — not yet):**
> Not yet — we're keeping it simple for the MVP. Everyone gets the same comprehensive report covering:
> - Online reputation (Google, Yelp, BBB)
> - Demographics & market data
> - Competitive landscape
> - Risk signals & red flags
> - Customer sentiment analysis
> 
> That said, if there's a specific data source you'd find valuable (e.g., Zillow for real estate comps, industry-specific databases), let me know! We're collecting feedback from early users to guide the roadmap.
> 
> What kind of data would you want to see?

---

### Q13: "I'm a broker. Can I white-label this for my clients?"

**Response:**
> Love this idea! Right now we're focused on individual buyers (MVP phase), but white-labeling for brokers is on the roadmap.
> 
> What we're thinking:
> - Brokers could offer DealScout reports as part of their listing package
> - White-labeled PDFs with broker branding
> - Volume discounts or affiliate commission (20%)
> 
> We're not ready to launch that yet, but if you're interested, I can add you to the "broker waitlist" and reach out when we build it.
> 
> How many listings do you typically handle per month? Trying to understand the use case.

---

### Q14: "What's your data retention policy? Is my search data private?"

**Response:**
> Good question — privacy matters, especially with sensitive acquisition plans.
> 
> **Current plan (subject to change):**
> - We store business name + location to generate the report
> - We do NOT store your email or payment info (handled by Stripe)
> - We do NOT share or sell your search data
> - We may anonymize & aggregate trends (e.g., "most searched industries") but never individual searches
> 
> **Why we store searches:**
> - To allow you to re-download reports
> - To improve report quality over time
> 
> If you want us to delete your search after delivery, email us and we'll purge it from our system.

---

### Q15: "Can you analyze businesses outside the US?"

**Response:**
> Not yet — MVP is US-only. Here's why:
> 
> - Our demographic data comes from US Census API
> - Review platforms (Google, Yelp) coverage is best in US
> - Legal/regulatory frameworks vary too much internationally
> 
> That said, Canada and UK are on the roadmap if there's demand. Are you looking at businesses in a specific country? If we get enough requests for [country], we'll prioritize it.
