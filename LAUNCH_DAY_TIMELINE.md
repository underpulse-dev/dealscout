8. Pin the URL

**What to expect:**

- Mix of supportive and skeptical responses

---

### 10:00 AM EST — STOP POSTING, START MONITORING
**Why stop here:** You've hit the 4 highest-value communities. More posts = diluted attention. Focus on engagement now.

---

**What to do:**

4. Update `distribution-tracking.md` with metrics

## 🚨 Common First-Day Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "Post got removed as spam"
- **Don't panic.** Reddit/HN sometimes auto-removes new accounts or certain keywords.
- Message the moderators politely: "Hi, my post was removed. I'm sharing a tool I built for feedback, not spam. Can you restore it?"
- Most mods are reasonable if you're genuine.

### Scenario 2: "Getting roasted in comments"
- **Stay calm.** Some people are skeptical by default.
- Use `RESPONSE_PLAYBOOK.md` to respond professionally.
- Don't argue — acknowledge valid points, clarify misunderstandings.
- Some of the harshest critics convert into best customers if you win them over.

### Scenario 3: "No engagement at all"
- **Common on HN.** Most Show HN posts die in /new.
- Reddit posts can take 2-3 hours to gain traction.
- SearchFunder moves slowly (responses can take a day).
- Don't give up after 2 hours — check back throughout the day.

### Scenario 4: "Someone asking for a free report"
- **First 3 requests:** Comp them in exchange for detailed feedback.
- **After that:** "I've already given a few free reports for feedback. Happy to offer you a discount code instead: [code]"

### Scenario 5: "Post goes viral"
- **Great problem to have!**
- Prioritize high-quality comments over volume.
- It's OK to say "Lots of great questions — I'll respond to all of them, might take a few hours!"
- Track email signups closely (might need to upgrade Google Form limits).

## 🎯 Day 2-7 Strategy

### Day 2-3: Monitor & Engage
- Check posts 2-3 times/day
- Respond to new comments
- Log metrics daily in `distribution-tracking.md`
- Don't post to new communities yet (let these breathe)

### Day 4-5: LinkedIn Post (Optional)
- If Reddit/HN went well → post on LinkedIn
- Use template from `post-templates.md` → LinkedIn section
- Tag it with #SmallBusiness #Entrepreneurship #DueDiligence

### Day 6-7: Checkpoint Evaluation
- Review metrics
- If <10 signups → consider ADDITIONAL_CHANNELS.md for more communities
- If 10+ signups → stay the course
- Notify Clawer: `[🎯 DealScout] Day 7 checkpoint: [status]`
