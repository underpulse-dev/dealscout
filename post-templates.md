## SearchFunder.com — Forum Post

**Subject:** "Built an AI tool to screen businesses before DD — feedback from actual buyers?"

**Body:**

Hey SearchFunder community,

I'm working on a tool to solve a problem I kept hearing about: buyers spending 10+ hours manually researching every listing before they even know if it's worth pursuing.

**The idea:** DealScout generates AI-powered pre-acquisition intelligence reports in 10 minutes. Think "Carfax for business acquisitions."

Each report includes:
- Reputation analysis (Google/Yelp/BBB reviews + sentiment trends)
- Competitive landscape (who else is nearby, their ratings, market saturation)
- Demographics & market fit (Census data, local income levels)
- Risk signals (declining reviews, negative press, operational red flags)
- Executive summary: Buy, Negotiate, or Walk Away

**Here's a real example:** [Stinkin Crawfish — Inglewood, CA](https://underpulse-dev.github.io/dealscout/report-1-stinkin-crawfish-inglewood.html) (actual business currently for sale, all real data)

**My question for you:** Would this be useful in your screening process? What would make this a "must-have" vs. "nice to have"?

Not trying to sell anything yet — genuinely want feedback from people who actually buy businesses. If there's interest, I'll build it. If not, I'll move on to the next idea.

**Title:** I built an AI tool to screen small business acquisitions before spending $15K on due diligence — thoughts?

**Body:**

If you've ever looked at buying a small business, you know the research is brutal. Every listing needs:
- Google Reviews checked
- Yelp ratings analyzed
- Competitors researched
- Demographics verified
- News/press scanned for red flags

Takes 10+ hours per business. And if you're screening 20 listings to find one worth pursuing, that's 200 hours of manual research.

**So I built DealScout** — AI-generated intelligence reports that automate the public data layer of screening. You enter a business name, and in 10 minutes you get a comprehensive report covering reputation, competition, demographics, and risk signals.

Think of it like a Carfax report before you pay for the mechanic's inspection.

**Here's a real sample:** [35W Auto Repair & Wash — Mounds View, MN](https://underpulse-dev.github.io/dealscout/report-2-35w-auto-repair-mounds-view.html) (actual business for sale, all real data)

**I'm looking for honest feedback:**
- Would this save you time in your screening process?
- What's missing that would make this a no-brainer?
- What would you pay for something like this?

Not selling anything yet — just validating if this is worth building. If there's demand, I'll finish it. If not, I'll move on.

**Title:** Built "Carfax for business acquisitions" — AI reports to screen deals before due diligence. Feedback?

**Body:**

I've been researching the business buying space and kept hearing the same pain point: screening takes forever.

Buyers looking at 10-20 listings spend hours manually checking Google Reviews, Yelp, competitors, demographics, press coverage — only to find half the businesses aren't even worth pursuing.

**I built DealScout to automate that screening layer.** Enter a business name → get an AI-generated report in 10 minutes covering:
- Reputation analysis (reviews, sentiment trends)
- Competitive landscape (who's nearby, market saturation)
- Demographics & market fit
- Risk signals (declining reviews, negative press)
- Go / No-Go recommendation

**Real example:** [Woof Gang Bakery — Austin, TX](https://underpulse-dev.github.io/dealscout/report-3-woof-gang-mueller-austin.html) (actual franchise for sale)

**Questions for the community:**
1. If you've bought or considered buying a business, would this have been useful?
2. What's the right price point? ($50? $100? $200?)
3. What am I missing?

I haven't built the backend yet — these sample reports were hand-crafted to validate the concept. If there's demand, I'll automate it. If not, I'll pivot.

**Title:** Show HN: DealScout – AI reports for small business buyers (Carfax for acquisitions)

**URL:** https://underpulse-dev.github.io/dealscout/

**Optional comment to post:**

Hi HN,

I built DealScout to solve a specific problem in the small business acquisition market: screening takes too long.

Buyers looking at 10-20 listings ($100K-$5M businesses) spend hours manually researching each one — Google Reviews, Yelp, competitors, demographics, press coverage — just to figure out which ones are worth pursuing.

DealScout automates that layer. You enter a business name, and in 10 minutes you get a comprehensive intelligence report covering:
- Reputation analysis (review trends, sentiment, common complaints)
- Competitive landscape (market saturation, competitor ratings)
- Demographics & market fit (Census data)
- Risk signals (declining reviews, negative press)
- Executive summary with recommendation

Sample reports on the landing page show what the output looks like (real businesses, real data).

Tech: Python + Claude API for analysis + web scraping. Reports cost ~$1-3 to generate, planning to price at $50-200 depending on depth.

This is pre-launch validation — I built sample reports manually to test the concept before building the full automation. Looking for feedback from anyone who's bought or sold a business, or just general thoughts on the approach.

## LinkedIn — Personal Post

**Post:**

I'm building something for people who buy small businesses.

The problem: screening potential acquisitions takes 10+ hours per listing. Google Reviews, Yelp, competitors, demographics, news scanning — it's manual, tedious, and necessary.

The idea: **DealScout** — AI-generated intelligence reports that automate the public data layer. Enter a business name → get a comprehensive screening report in 10 minutes.

Think "Carfax for business acquisitions."

Here's a real example:
👉 [Sample Report: Auto Repair Shop in Minnesota](https://underpulse-dev.github.io/dealscout/report-2-35w-auto-repair-mounds-view.html)

I'm validating demand before building the full product. If you've ever looked at buying a business (or know someone who has), I'd love your feedback:

🔹 Would this save you time?
🔹 What's missing?
🔹 What would you pay?

Landing page: https://underpulse-dev.github.io/dealscout/

Not selling anything yet — just figuring out if this is worth building. Appreciate any thoughts!

**Post:**

Hey everyone,

Quick question for those who've bought or considered buying a small business:

How much time do you spend researching each listing before deciding if it's worth pursuing?

I've been hearing 10+ hours per business (Google Reviews, Yelp, competitors, demographics, press scanning) — and that's BEFORE you even start due diligence.

I built a tool to automate that screening layer: **DealScout** — AI-generated intelligence reports that cover the public data side of pre-acquisition research.

Here's what a report looks like: [Sample Report — Auto Repair Shop](https://underpulse-dev.github.io/dealscout/report-2-35w-auto-repair-mounds-view.html) (real business, real data)

Would this be useful to you? What would make it a no-brainer?

Not trying to sell anything — genuinely looking for feedback before I decide if this is worth finishing.

## General Tips for Posting

1. **Don't be salesy.** Frame it as "I built this, is it useful?" not "Buy my product!"
2. **Engage with comments.** Respond within 6 hours, especially on Reddit/HN.
3. **Be humble.** "I'm figuring this out" > "This is the future of business buying"
4. **Show, don't tell.** Link to sample reports — let the product speak for itself.
5. **Ask questions.** People love giving advice. "What would you pay?" gets engagement.
6. **Don't spam.** Post once per community. Don't cross-post to multiple subreddits on the same day.
7. **Track which post performs best.** Double down on that channel.

---

**Remember:** The goal is validation, not sales. If 50+ people say "I'd use this" → we have demand. If crickets → pivot or kill.
